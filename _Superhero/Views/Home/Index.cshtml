        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
        specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
        the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
        including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <h2>
            1914 translation by H. Rackham
        </h2>
        <p>
            "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing 
            pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account
            of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth,
            the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
            because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
            encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
            pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
            circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a 
            trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain
            some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy 
            a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
